1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv
Ans: Use FileZilla to move sales_order_data.csv from the laptop to the Cloudera VM (192.168.56.101) 
to folder /home/cloudera/

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
Ans: create a hdfs directory using the following command:
hadoop fs -mkdir /sales
then Go to (1) in the Cloudera terminal or (2) thru ssh cloudera@192.168.56.101 from the laptop(mac) terminal or (3) putty
type the below command at the $ prompt:
hadoop fs -put /home/cloudera/sales_order_data.csv /sales
hadoop fs -ls /sales/ 

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv_v1" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
Ans: go to hive prompt and type the below to use the correct hive database created earlier
use hive_class_b1;
show tables;

# create csv table for sales data

create table sales_order_csv_v1
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1")
; 

# load sales_order_data.csv data into above mentioned tables
4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv_v1" 
load data inpath 'sales/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_data_csv_v1;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_dat_orc"
create table sales_order_data_orc
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_data_csv_v1" into "sales_order_data_orc"
insert overwrite table sales_order_data_orc select * from sales_order_data_csv_v1;

Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_data_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
